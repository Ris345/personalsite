I am a self-taught software developer with a passion for problem-solving. I enjoy breaking down problems into smaller parts and analyzing them every step of the way. Programming is a vast world and my choice as a software developer reflects my passion and drive as an individual. 

I fell in love with programming after writing my first “Hello World”.  I witnessed something magical about programming that was filled with endless possibilities. It continues to challenge me in ways that other things in the past did not. It keeps me constantly searching and in this process it rewards me with endless wisdom. 

I am excited to share my growth and collaborate with others on exciting projects. Constantly learning and educating myself makes me more adaptable to changing technology. As a software developer I aspire to work on projects that positively affect our lives.
